					<p>Hi, I am Jihyun. I was born in a small town, South Korea. When I was young, I was always curious about foreign countries and their culture. I always wanted to have chances to go abroad. I studied international trading at university. Because I thought that workig for a trading company could make me have more opportunities to travel around the world.</p>
					<p>After I graduated from university, I finally had a chance to live abroad. I went to Canada and I lived in a small town called Whistler for 1 year. It was an amazing experience. Everything was different from Korea. I really enjoyed living there. I improved my English a lot, I worked in a few  places and I had some good trips to the cities near Whistler. But the best thing was that I met many nice people who were from various countries. Most of them were so kind and it was really enjoyable to talk to them about dreams, culture and life.</p>
					<p>After I went back to Korea, I started working for a travel agency. But the job was quite different from what I expected. So several months later, I moved to an advertising company and worked in a sales department. But it didn't take so long to realise that I am not good at sales business. So I had to find a new job, but at the time, I didn't know what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be. So, I decided to have a break to think and find what I want to do for my future.</p>
					<p>I came to London and I got a job as a barista. One of my colleagues was very nice and he is my husband now. After the barista job, I worked as an office administrator in an online based trading company for 2 years and now I am studying programming and coding to be a web developer!</p>

			<h2><i class="fas fa-laptop headingIcon"></i>Why coding?</h2>
			<p>I've worked for a travel agency, an advertising company, a coffee shop and a trading company so far. The reason I've changed my job many times is that I've never felt any passion or satisfaction from my job. When I quit my last job a few months ago, I felt like 'I've been in a desert for years and I could never find an oasis'. The problem was that I didn't know what I am good at and what I like to do. So I started searching for the oasis.</p>
			<p>A couple of weeks later, I found an interesting blog. The owner of the blog was a Founders and Coders graduate. She wrote all of her journey she passed through to become a developer. Her story was interesting and it was impressive that she didn't know anything about coding at the beginning, and about a year later she got a job as a developer. I started freeCodeCamp to give it a try and I fell in love with coding straightaway. I finally feel like 'I found the thing for me and I am on the right track now'.</p>
			<p>First of all, the reason I like coding is that coding is clear and logical. Codes never lie. If my codes are not working, there is always a reason. If I find and correct it, then they work. I like all the process of writing codes, finding mistakes and modifying them. Completing course prerequisites especially Codewars, was very enjoyable. Here are the links:

			<i class="fab fa-github"></i></p>
			<p>Coding is used for various purposes in various fields. That is the second reason I like coding. We can connect coding with almost everything.</p>
